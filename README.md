# DStore

## Overview
DStore is a scalable data storage solution, drawing inspiration from Redis, renowned for its simplicity and performance. This project is for helping me learn Scala.

### Supported Commands
- **`Ping` Command**: Responds with `PONG`, a simple yet effective way to check the connectivity and responsiveness of the DStore server.
- **`Echo` Command**: Returns the same string that is sent to it, demonstrating basic interaction and response capabilities.

## How to Build
DStore is structured into two main components: the CLI (Command Line Interface) and the Server. These are managed as separate projects within an SBT (Scala Build Tool) build environment.

### Prerequisites
- Scala (version 2.13.12 or newer)
- SBT (Scala Build Tool)

### Building the Projects
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Doug-Luce/dstore
   cd dstore
   ```

2. **Compile the Projects**:
   Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command to compile both the CLI and Server projects:
   ```sh
   sbt compile
   ```

3. **Running the Server**:
   To start the DStore server, execute the following command:
   ```sh
   sbt "project server" run
   ```
   This will start the server component of DStore, listening for incoming connections and commands.

4. **Running the CLI**:
   In a separate terminal, you can start the CLI component to interact with the server. Use the following command:
   ```sh
   sbt "project cli" run
   ```

   Once the CLI is running, you can issue commands to the server. For example:
   - To use the `ping` command, type `ping` and press Enter. The server should respond with `PONG`.
   - To use the `echo` command, type `echo <your message>` and press Enter. The server will echo back the message you sent.
5. **Exiting the server**: To exit the server use the `exit` command at the `Server>` prompt
```sh
   Server> exit
```
